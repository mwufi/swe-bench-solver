      "\n",
      "In the past specifying a dialect was **optional**. If unspecified, the dialect defaulted to `ansi`. Because of this there is a warning presented when sqlfluff runs in parse mode and the dialect is set to ansi and parsing errors are encountered.\n",

      "\n",
      "I opened this issue to document the idea and solicit feedback. \n",
      "1. The simplest improvement to make the message more appropriate is to just change it to this:\n",
      "\n",
      "`WARNING: Parsing errors found and dialect is set to 'ansi'. Is 'ansi' the correct dialect?`\n",
      "\n",
      "2. On the other hand, we know that the user explicitly set the dialect to `ansi`. So why bother asking if it was intentional? We don't ask if you meant postgres or tsql. There's an argument to simply remove the warning altogether.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Finally, we could potentially differentiate between `--dialect ansi` passed on the command line vs the dialect being picked up from a `.sqlfluff` config file. Perhaps the warning should be displayed only the in the case where the dialect was picked up implicitly from the config file.\n",

      "Equals is no longer in the index 2, but has been bumped to index 4, yet we are not in the expanded block form of set assignments. This causes the `inside_set_or_macro` flag to be incorrectly set to `True`, as if we were using a block assignment, which causes the entire template to be ignored (or something like that), and leads to the eventual `ValueError` raised.\n",

      "if len(filtered_trimmed_parts) < 3 or filtered_trimmed_parts.count(\"=\") != 1:\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "This one seems more promising, specially considering that multiple targets appear not to be supported with block assignments (at least, that's what I think, as the docs don't mention it, and trying it locally raises a too many values to unpack error). Thus, the first condition will always be true for block assignments (so, even the presence of an equals in the body of the assignment would not cause issues).\n",

However, the composition logic of `PVSystem: def __init__(arrays,...)` combined with the inheritance logic of `SingleAxisTracker(PVSystem)` makes for an odd combination of `Array` objects within `SingleAxisTrackers`.

However, sometimes a user might have their own tracker rotations but not have the corresponding `surface_tilt` and `surface_azimuth` values.  Here are a few motivating examples:\n",

The advantages are it will be faster (no imports, no filesystem traversal), it's not dependent on the local environment,  and it's maintained upstream, generated from source.

      "**Describe the bug**\n",
      "Accessing sequences via `Dataset.__getattr__` seems to leak memory. The bug occurred for me when I was processing many DICOMs and manipulating some tags contained in sequences and each leaked a bit of memory, ultimately crashing the process.\n",

In the process of categorizing the old data elements into either IS or DS, not only were the obvious integers (like counts of images and other things) made into integers, but it appears that also any \"real world\" attribute that in somebody's expert opinion did not need greater precision than a whole integer, was so constrained as well.\"\n",
